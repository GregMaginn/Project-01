# Project-01
# as a group we would like to uncover patterns between the top 200 songs on spotify regarding genre, ranking, and yearly trends
# we want to look at the years through 2017-2020
# the type of questions we would like to ask are:
# 1. the prevelence of certain artists/genre's within the top 200
# 2. the minimum required views to become a top 200 artist
# 3. how the top 200 songs are correlated to the year overall as a whole
